## Overview
It is based on the Go implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers varint specification.
- Varints are a method of serializing integers using one or more bytes.
- Smaller numbers take a smaller number of bytes.

#### For more details see 
- [https://github.com/multiformats/go-varint](https://github.com/multiformats/go-varint)
- [ipfs/QmXJXJMai4p88HMsp2TPP1EtZxfSZQ1vyRtN5dGKvQ6MCw](ipfs/QmXJXJMai4p88HMsp2TPP1EtZxfSZQ1vyRtN5dGKvQ6MCw)

#### The encoding rules are:
-   Unsigned integers are serialized 7 bits at a time, starting with the least significant bits.
-   The most significant bit (msb) in each output byte indicates if there is a continuation byte.
-   Signed integers are mapped to unsigned integers using "zig-zag" encoding:
    - Positive values x are written as 2*x + 0,
    - Negative values x are written as 2*(~x) + 1
    - So, negative values are complemented and whether to complement is encoded in bit 0.


## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
```Swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-varint.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
    
    ...
)
```

## Usage

### Example

```Swift

import VarInt

/// Create some arbitrary data
let bytes = [UInt8]("Hello World".data(using: .utf8)!)

/// Prefix the bytes with their length so we can recover the data later
let uVarIntLengthPrefixedBytes = putUVarInt(UInt64(bytes.count)) + bytes

/// ... send the data across a network or something ...

/// Read the length prefixed data to determine the length of the payload
let lengthPrefix = uVarInt(uVarIntLengthPrefixedBytes)
print(lengthPrefix.value)     // 11 -> `Hello World` == 11 bytes
print(lengthPrefix.bytesRead) // 1  -> The value `11` fits into 1 byte

/// So dropping the first byte will result in our original data again...
let recBytes = [UInt8](uVarIntLengthPrefixedBytes.dropFirst(lengthPrefix.bytesRead))

/// The original bytes and the recovered bytes are equal
print(bytes == recBytes) // True

```

### API
```Swift
/// Signed VarInts
public func putVarInt(_ value: Int64) -> [UInt8] 
public func varInt(_ buffer: [UInt8]) -> DecodedVarInt   // (value:  Int64, bytesRead: Int)

/// Unsigned VarInts
public func putUVarInt(_ value: UInt64) -> [UInt8]
public func uVarInt(_ buffer: [UInt8]) -> DecodedUVarInt // (value: UInt64, bytesRead: Int)
```
